Q. What are the largest size MM programs that can be run?
A. Matrices of size >9454 result in a compiler error. Hence, matrices smaller than this threshold value can be run. 

Q. How much do they page fault?
A. Executing with 4 threads, the following matrix size to number of page faults relation is obtained:

matrix size          number of page faults
100                  147
250                  455
300                  616
500                  1044
800                  773
1000                 839


Q. What are the largest size (n using matmul) programs that can be run with limited pagefaults?
A. By setting a limit of 1000 page faults, we are able to run programs with matrix sizes of the order <500.

NOTE: We have used the getrlimit() and setrlimit() system calls and run the program. The appropriate output statistics can be found in output.txt and in the screenshot attached.
